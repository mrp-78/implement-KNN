## Dataset
In this notebook we use Adult dataset.

The Adult data set was extracted in 1994 from census data of the United States. It contains continuous and nominal attributes, describing some social information (age, race, sex, marital status, ...) about the citizens registered.

The task is to predict whether the citizenâ€™s income exceeds fifty thousand dollars a year.
